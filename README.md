# Model Transformation Assignment
This has been tested on an Ubuntu VM.
Note: framerate is much slower on my VM than on my windows laptop, so mileage may vary.
### Building + Running
- Type 'make' in the top level directory that contains the Makefile.
- This should create an executable called 'main.'
- To run the program, simply type: ./main
### Key Inputs
- The program will start with Al in the top right and Suzanne in the bottom left, rotating on their combined axis. If you want to exit this mode and be able to move Al around, press 1 on the keyboard.
- Translation: WASD
- Rotation: arrow keys
- Scaling: brackets
